A dump for all of my noob C codes, let see if I can code like a real Computer Science person! (Send Help)

## initial setup
NOTE: This was my actual Windows 10 (Administrator) setup
1. Download [CodeBlocks](https://www.codeblocks.org/downloads/binaries/) with MinGW setup.
 - I downloaded CodeBlocks, but thought, I still prefer Notepad++ and Command Prompt
2. Once downloaded, run and complete the setup.
3. Add **MinGW/bin** to System PATH:
 - Locate and copy the full path of `C:\...\CodeBlocks\MinGW\bin`
 - Search for "Edit the system environment variables" (under System Properties > Advanced)
 - Click the **Environment Variables...** button
 - Under the System variables, edit **Path**
 - Add **MinGW/bin** to Path
4. Launch command prompt, then run `gcc -v` to verify if setup is OK.
5. Done, you can now start coding in C!

## Using GCC
```cmd
gcc <filename>.c -o <appname>
<appname>
```

## Build, Run Faster
1. Create a new CMD/Batch file, e.g. `build.cmd`
```cmd
cls
setlocal ENABLEDELAYEDEXPANSION
set f=%1
set f=%f:.c=%
cls
gcc %f%.c -o %f%
%f%
```
2. Add the Batch file's directory to Path (System variables)
3. Launch Command Prompt application
 - Locate your code directory
 - Run command: `build <filename>` (without the **.c**)

## disclaimer
1. Codes might be too bookish and not simplified, teach me senpai!
2. Some implementations are not yet optimized (or correct?), because author is still at beginner level.
3. Some time complexity calculations may be wrong, but will be corrected as I learn how to do it properly.
4. Other things might have been overlooked, I will work on that.
